							<h3>Restore turns to Rebuild</h3>
							<p>
								In the summer of 2013 Grandmother gifted us the trailer and the restoration began.  
								We originally planned to simply get it road ready and take it to a guy in Johnson city 
								who was know for vintage restoration.  So we got on his waiting list and started cleaning 
								up the wheels, getting new tires and repacking the bearings.  We took it to him in early 2014 with 
								his promise to complete the project in 3 months.  Sadly, 6 months later he had only spent 3 hours and was 
								furious with us for asking him how much longer it would take.

								So with encouragement from a coworker we decided to take the project on ourselves.  After tearing into the 
								walls and seeing the rot, we knew we needed to replace a lot of structural wood.  I found some photos online of 
								a similar style camper rebuild and we quickly realized a full rebuild would be the only way.

								<h3>Back to square one</h3>
								<p>
									Our restoration project became a complete rebuild.  The water damage was mostly focused 
									on the ceiling and the lower corners where the walls meet the floor.  We decided the best 
									route was to remove all the aluminum and remove the walls.  We took the trailer structure 
									and floor to a shop that sand blasted it and enamel coated.
